## Layout Approach

### Design Philosophy

### Responsive Considerations
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger screens
- **Flexible Grid**: CSS Grid with `auto-fill` and `minmax()` for adaptive columns
- **Scalable Typography**: Font sizes that scale appropriately across devices
- **Touch-Friendly**: Adequate button sizes and spacing for mobile interaction
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper aspect ratios
